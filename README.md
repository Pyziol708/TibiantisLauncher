## Will I get banned for using it?
The goal of the project is **not** and **never will** be cheating or gaining the advantage over other players. The application is safe and does not interfere with the client upon launching.

### How do I start with pre-compiled binary?
1. Place the binaries and .dll's directly into the client folder and run *TibiantisLauncher.exe*. The game client should **not** be running!
1. Create your profile by clicking *ADD PROFILE* button in the bottom-left corner of the window. Enter the desired profile name and confirm.
1. New profile should now appear on the list. You can double-click it or select and click *START CLIENT*.
1. That's it! Configure your client and join the game! Note that you can also edit and delete any profile by right-clicking it.

## How do I import/duplicate configuration file between profiles?
At the time of writing this tutorial, it is not possible to import/duplicate profiles using GUI. You have to do it manually. At first, make sure your created your profile as described above. If your client is now running, please close it down.
1. Find your destination .cfg file you wish to be replaced:
    1. open Tibiantis client installation folder and go to *profiles* subfolder,
    1. edit *profiles.xml* file,
    1. search for your profile name in *Name* attribute of *Profile* tag,
    1. the *CfgId* attribute is the equivalent of .cfg file number in *profiles* folder,
    1. close *profiles.xml* editor.
1. Make a copy of your source .cfg file:
    - the default Tibiantis config file is placed in client installation folder: *Tibiantis/game/Tibiantis.cfg*,
    - you may also copy a .cfg file of desired profile from *profiles* folder.
1. Rename source file to match your destination .cfg file and replace it.

1. Start Tibiantis Launcher and enjoy!
