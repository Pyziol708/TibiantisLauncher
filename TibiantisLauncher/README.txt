## Will I get banned for using it?

The goal of the project is not and never will be cheating or
gaining the advantage over other players.

### How do I start with pre-compiled binary?

1.  Place the binaries and .dll's directly into the client folder and
    run TibiantisLauncher.exe. The game client should not be
    running!
2.  Create your profile by clicking + button in the
    top-right of the window. Enter the desired profile name and
    confirm.
3.  New profile should now appear on the list. You can double-click it
    or select and click START CLIENT.
4.  That's it! Configure your client and join the game! Note that you
    can also edit and delete any profile by right-clicking it.

## How do I import/duplicate configuration file between profiles?

At the time of writing this tutorial, it is not possible to
import/duplicate profiles using GUI. You have to do it manually. At
first, make sure your created your profile as described above. If your
client is now running, please close it down.

1.  Find your desired .cfg file you wish to be replaced:
  a.  open Tibiantis client installation
folder and go to profiles subfolder,
  b.  edit profiles.xml file,
  c.  search for your profile name in *Name* attribute of Profile tag,
  d.  the CfgId attribute is the equivalent of .cfg file name in *profiles*
      folder,
  e.  close *profiles.xml* editor. 
2.  Make a copy of your source .cfg file: - the default Tibiantis config file is placed in client
    installation folder: Tibiantis/game/Tibiantis.cfg, - you may also copy
  a  .cfg file of desired profile from profiles folder.
3.  Rename the file to match your desired .cfg and replace it.
4.  Start Tibiantis Launcher and enjoy!
